## Project
This project is originally from: https://github.com/AudioMLLab/dov-audio-filter

We made some small modifications to train this model.

Data should be put in a subdirectory `data/`

The code for collecting the data using [Respeaker](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/cn/ReSpeaker-USB-Mic-Array/) is placed in `usb_4_mic_array/`

`usb_4_mic_array/record_channels.py` is recording 4 channels signals separately.
